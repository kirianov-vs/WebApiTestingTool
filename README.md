# WebApiTestingTool

This tool allows user to send http requests and log StatusCode and Response from server.

List of the http-methods support:
  - HTTP-GET

Just put all http request to the 'ListOfRequests.txt', one request per line. 

  After .exe start just follow the instructions before testrun:
  - Show the list ? (of http requests) Y\N
  - Run test sequentially ? Y\N (if Y key pressed - all test will run sequentially in order of list, otherwise if another key pressed - simultaneously)
  
  In the end of test run you will hear the 3rd-times beep by the console, and summury with the PASSED and FAILED requests.
