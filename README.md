# WebApiTestingTool

This tool allows user to send http requests and log StatusCode and Response from server.

Just put all http request to the 'ListOfRequests.txt', one request per line. 

  After .exe start just follow the instructions before testrun:
  - Show the list ? (of http requests) Y\N
  - Run test sequentially ? (if Y key pressed - all test will run sequentially in order of list, otherwise if another key pressed - simultaneously )
  
  In the end of test run you will hear the 3rd-times beep by the console, and summury with the PASSED and FAILED requests.
